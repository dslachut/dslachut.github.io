I'm what you might call a **Full-Stack Data Scientist**.

Data Science is a process, not a product. I have experience with every step of
that process. My completed projects include work you would call Data
Engineering, Machine Learning Engineering, Software Development, System
Administration, Systems Research, and Systems Analysis---along with Data Science
itself.

Beyond the technical work, Data Science requires communication. I have taught
students and mentored colleagues. I have presented research to technical and
non-technical audiences. I have written for academic researchers, technology
professionals, and military officers.

Real solutions are **system-oriented** and **user-focused**. You need a data
system to be technically sound from data collection to knowledge output. That
system must be built for and usable by humans. I am passionate about bringing
that orientation and focus to new challenges.

What have I done?

Here are a few of the highlights so far.

- I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science.
- I discovered and helped to correct more than 20 errors in ACAS-X, the
  next-generation international standard for Air Collision Avoidance.
- I was Tech Lead on a set of generative AI projects with a total contract value
  \>$1M.
- I built GIS backend services for the top SaaS product for farm-land analysis.
