Like many (most?) people, I used to have a blog. It was a repository for works-in-progress, copies of presentations, technical musings, and how-to guides. Some time in the course of writing a dissertation, starting a professional career, having a few children, moving halfway across the USA, etc... It now comes up as a HTTP 502 error behind an expired certificate. 

## The reason

In October 2023, my former employer had to do a restructuring and reduction-in-force. It was the correct decision, even if it was inconvenient for me. It's given me more time with the family and a good reason to start writing again.

## The plan

This blog, should I be able to maintain it, will be like the old. 
- Notes about my works-in-progress
- Copies of presentations I give 
- Technical musings
- How-to guides
- And, maybe add in some occasional hobby posting.

Should I not be able to maintain it... I will attempt to remove it from the Internet before anyone notices. Wish me luck!
